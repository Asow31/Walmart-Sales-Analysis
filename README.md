# Walmart Sales Analysis

This project looks at Walmart retail sales data to understand revenue patterns, product performance, and how different stores or categories contribute to overall sales. The goal was to explore the data, build a clean dashboard, and highlight insights that can help guide business decisions.


## Tools Used
- Excel / CSV for data preparation
- Tableau
- Statistics and summary tables

## 1. Understanding the Data
The dataset included information such as:
- date of sales  
- store/branch  
- product category  
- unit price and quantity  
- gross income and tax  

I started by checking the structure of the dataset, looking for missing values, and making sure the columns were formatted correctly.

## 2. Cleaning and Preparing the Data
- Removed empty or duplicate rows  
- Standardized date formats  
- Calculated totals (sales, tax, gross income)  
- Created additional fields for the dashboard (if needed)

## 3. Exploring the Data
I looked at trends in:
- daily/weekly/monthly sales  
- top-selling product categories  
- revenue differences between stores/branches  
- average transaction size  
- seasonal or time-based patterns  

This helped show which parts of the business were performing well and where things were slower.

## 4. Dashboard and Visualization
I built a dashboard that displays:
- total sales  
- sales over time  
- highest and lowest performing categories  
- store/branch comparisons  
- gross income patterns  

The visuals make it easy for someone to quickly understand what’s driving revenue and which areas need attention.

## 5. Key Insights
- Some product categories consistently outperform others.  
- Sales vary noticeably between branches, showing different customer behavior.  
- Certain days or months have clear spikes in revenue.  
- Average transaction value changes depending on store and category.
